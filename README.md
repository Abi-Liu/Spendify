# Spendify

This project is a new and improved version of my previous personal finance app, [Finance Me](https://github.com/Abi-Liu/Finance-Me). In this iteration, I'm learning to use new technologies, such as Docker, Postgres, Redis, and Websockets.
This is still currently a work in progress, but feel free to look through what I have available.
